# Random Quote Generator
This is a simple web application that generates random quotes. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework and jQuery library. The quotes are stored in a JavaScript array, and a new quote is randomly selected and displayed on the page every time the "Generate Quote" button is clicked.

The application also includes a contact page where users can send feedback or inquiries. The contact form is integrated with Mailtrap, a tool for testing email delivery in a development environment.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

To use the contact form, you will need to replace the placeholders in the contact.html file with your own Mailtrap credentials.
